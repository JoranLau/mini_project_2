# mini_project_2
This is mini project 2, which consists of three trained models. 

Model_vgg.py use CNN based on vgg model to train a classifying model. 
Model_softmax.py uses softmax function to train a model. 
Model_MLP.py uses Multilayer Perceptron to train a model. 
Each model will output an .h5 file which can be use in the next step. 
Use test_predict.py to predict a photo, by doing this you must put a photo under current folder. 
The dataset contains of 2 classes -- daisy & tulips, so all of the models could only classify either one of them.
